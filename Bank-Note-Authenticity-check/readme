A Data Science Model which involves predicting whether a given banknote is authentic, given a number of measures taken from a photograph.

Description of Dataset : The dataset contains 1,372 rows with 5 numeric variables. It is a classification problem with two classes (binary classification).

Below provides a list of the five variables in the dataset.variance of Wavelet
Transformed image (continuous).
1. skewness of Wavelet Transformed image (continuous).
2. kurtosis of Wavelet Transformed image (continuous).
3. entropy of image (continuous).
4. class (integer).

Algorithm: To make the model, CART (Classification and Regression Trees) Algorithm is Implemented.
